# Template

## Description

This project is my personal starting template for making multi-modular Android projects. It is based
on [Now in Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid) and 
[Android Architecture Templates](https://github.com/android/architecture-templates) while keeping
lightweight enough that I can add other libraries of choice, like which DI framework to use. It 
contains many linters and static analysis tools to ensure code quality and consistency.
